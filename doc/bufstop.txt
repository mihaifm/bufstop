==============================================================================
1. INTRO                                                      *bufstop-intro*

If you find yourself frequently switching back and forth between files, and 
looking for a faster way to do it, well...your journey has come to an end. 
Welcome to the |Bufstop| !

|Bufstop| is a plugin for faster buffer switching, built for efficiency and
less keystrokes. It provides no less than 7 ways to display and switch buffers.

The |:Bufstop| command opens a new window at the bottom of the screen 
contataining the list of current buffers, ordered by most recently used. 
Each buffer has an associated hotkey displayed besides it. When pressed, the 
correspoding buffer is loaded, with the focus remaining in the Bufstop window. 
This way you can quickly preview buffers with only 1 keystroke !

The Bufstop window is easily dismissed with the <Esc> key.

There is also a |:BufstopFast| command which opens the Bufstop window in the 
same way, but spares you the effort of pressing the <Esc> key : the window 
closes automatically after you select a buffer.

Note: If you're using the recommended mappings (see below), {,b2} will 
always take you to the previously opened file (aka alternate buffer)

==============================================================================
2. PREVIEW MODE                                              *bufstop-preview*

The |:BufstopPreview| command is similar to the |:Bufstop| command, with the
notable difference that you can preview and navigate files by moving
up or down in the window with j, k or the arrow keys.

It is a powerful and instant way to check your files.

Note: You can still switch files by pressing the hotkeys associated with them.

==============================================================================
3. BUFSTOP MODE                                                 *bufstop-mode*

Don't like a pottentially huge file list popping on the screen? 
Use the |:BufstopMode| command. Buffers will be displayed in the command line, 
in the same order: by most recently used.

In this mode, you can only press numbers. Pressing 3 will take you to the 
3rd recently used buffer. However here's the catch: because the 3rd buffer 
will now be first in the hierarchy, it's place will be taken by another buffer.   
So pressing 33333.... will cycle between the last 3 buffers.
Similarly, 4444 will cycle the last 4 buffers, and so on.

Pressing <Esc> will dismiss the mode. There is a |:BufstopModeFast| alternative, 
which dismisses the mode once you select a buffer.

Note: The first buffer labeled with 1 will always be the current file.

==============================================================================
4. BUFSTOP STATUSLINE                                      *bufstop-statusline*

The |:BufstopStatusline| command works the same way as |:BufstopMode|, but 
displays the buffers on the statusline. 
As before, there is a fast alternative, |:BufstopStatuslineFast| that will close 
the mode once you select something.

Note: No worries, your old statusline is restored once you exit the mode.

==============================================================================
5. EXTREME SPEED                                                *bufstop-speed*

The previous methods are cool, but they still require a mapping to bring up 
the buffer list, typically <leader>b
Looking for a faster way? Use the |:BufstopSpeedToggle| command. 

It creates the following mappings: <leader>2 opens the previous buffer,
<leader>3 to open the 3rd recently used buffer, and so on.

Using |:BufstopSpeedToggle| again will clear out these mappings.

Note: Pressing ,5,5,5... will cycle the last 5 buffers.

==============================================================================
6. ULTIMATE                                                 *bufstop-ultimate*

The previous speed method requires 2 keys to open any arbitrary buffer. 
Too much? Put this in your |vimrc|:
>
    let g:BufstopSpeedKeys = ["<F1>", "<F2>", "<F3>", "<F4>", "<F5>", "<F6>"]
    let g:BufstopLeader = ""
    let g:BufstopAutoSpeedToggle = 1

Yes, you guessed it. 1 key to open arbitrary buffers!

Once again, pressing <F4><F4><F4>... will cycle between the last 4 buffers.

Note: Already had something mapped to <Fx> ? Use |:BufstopSpeedToggle| to switch 
off these mapping. Bufstop will attempt to restore your old mappings (given 
that you didn't use |noremap|).

==============================================================================
7. BONUSES                                                     *bufstop-bonus*

As a bonus, this plugin provides navigation history for each window.
Use the |:BufstopBack| and |:BufstopForward| to navigate this history.

The other bonus is the ability to sort the buffers by MFU (most frequently
used). Use the |g:BufstopSorting| option to activate this powerful feature.

==============================================================================
8. RECOMMENDED MAPPINGS                                   *bufstop-recommended*

Hopefully we're not crazy to type in those long command names. You can use the below 
mappings or create your own:
>
    map <leader>b :Bufstop<CR>          
    map <leader>a :BufstopModeFast<CR> 
    map <C-tab>   :BufstopBack<CR>
    map <S-tab>   :BufstopForward<CR>
    let g:BufstopAutoSpeedToggle = 1        

==============================================================================
9. COMMANDS                                                 *bufstop-commands*

|:Bufstop| 

Invokes the |Bufstop| window. Inside it, each buffer will have an associated 
hotkey that can be used to open the buffer. 

In addition, the following key mappings are present in the |Bufstop| window:
>
    d          wipe the selected buffer.
    <CR>       Open the selected buffer.
    <Esc>      Dismiss the Bufstop window
    k,j        Move up/down to select a buffer.

|:BufstopFast|                                                   *:BufstopFast*

Same as |:Bufstop|, but the window is closed after you select a buffer.    

|:BufstopPreview|                                             *:BufstopPreview*

Display the most recently used buffers in the command line and enter Bufstop 
mode. In this mode you can press only a number coresponding to a buffer, or 
the <Esc> key which exits the mode. The number of displayed files can be
configured using the `g:BufstopModeNumFiles` option.

Same as |:BufstopStatusline| but exists the mode once a buffer is selected.

|:BufstopSpeedToggle|                                         *:BufstopSpeedToggle*

Toggle speed mappings. The defaults are <leader>2 to go to the 2nd recently 
used buffer, <leader>3 to go to the 3rd, an so on. These can be configured 
using the |g:BufstopSpeedKeys| and |g:BufstopLeader| options.
